Welcome to BookTrac!

I created this app because I enjoy reading and wanted an easy way for others to keep track of the books they have read as well as those they are currently reading.

The app allows users to add details about the books they are reading including the book's title, author, number of pages and current reading progress. They also have the option to edit those details or delete a book completely.

The technlogies I used to build this app include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.
